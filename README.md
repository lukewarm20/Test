#These scripts are used for and designed for xdotool
#Note: This is been tested in the newest (at this time) kali linux 2.0 gnome desktop
#Note2: I changed the run command shortcut in the testing due to some minor issues with opening a new terminal. To change the shortcut go to settings->keyboard->(tab)-system-> then "change run the command prompt" by clicking on it
